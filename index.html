        <H2>About Me</H2>
        <p>My name is Karina. I was born in California, and lived there until I was 6. We then moved to Washington,
            Minnesota, Kentucky, and then back to California when I was 16. Even though I thought I hated moving so much
            as a kid, as an adult I continued to move. I went to Hawaii for college, moved back to California for
            awhile, then to Arizona, and now I live in Utah.</p>
